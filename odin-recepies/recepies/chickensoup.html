    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 large onion, halved</li>

</div>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil
        over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes.
        Skim off foam every so often, as needed.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and
        bones.</li>
    <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables
        into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.</li>
    <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</li>
</ol>
